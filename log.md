# STORM Development Log

## What is STORM?

**STORM** (Synchronous Transfer Orchestration for RAM Memory) is a revolutionary system designed to eliminate the VRAM memory wall in deep learning without requiring AI prediction or custom hardware.

### Core Problem STORM Solves:
- **VRAM Memory Wall**: Large neural networks require massive amounts of GPU memory (VRAM) for storing activations during training
- **Current Limitation**: Most GPUs have limited VRAM (8GB-24GB), forcing researchers to use smaller models or expensive hardware
- **STORM's Solution**: Offload activations to CPU RAM and use sophisticated memory orchestration to maintain high GPU utilization

### How STORM Works:
1. **Forward Pass**: Computes activations and immediately offloads them to CPU RAM using pinned memory
2. **Backward Pass**: Orchestrates memory transfers so that while the GPU computes gradients for layer N, it simultaneously fetches activations for layer N-1 from CPU RAM
3. **Zero-Stall Architecture**: Uses CUDA streams and events to ensure GPU compute and memory transfer happen concurrently
4. **Target Performance**: Achieve â‰¥80% GPU utilization while keeping activations in CPU RAM

### Key Technologies:
- **CUDA/C++**: Low-level GPU control with kernels, streams, events, and pinned memory
- **PyTorch Autograd**: Custom forward/backward functions to intercept computation
- **Memory Management**: Asynchronous memcpy operations and PCIe bandwidth optimization
- **Profiling**: NVIDIA profiler to verify concurrent execution

### MVP Goal:
Create a working system that can train deep neural networks with activations stored in CPU RAM while maintaining high GPU utilization, proving the concept works without custom hardware.
