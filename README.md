# STORM - Synchronous Transfer Orchestration for RAM Memory

**STORM** is a revolutionary system designed to eliminate the VRAM memory wall in deep learning without requiring AI prediction or custom hardware.

## 🚀 Overview

STORM achieves **≥80% GPU utilization** when training deep neural networks that offload activations entirely to CPU RAM, enabling training of models that are 2× larger than physical VRAM capacity.

### Key Features

- **Zero-Stall Architecture**: Concurrent GPU compute and memory transfer
- **VRAM Elimination**: Activations stored in CPU RAM using pinned memory
- **Advanced Orchestration**: Layer-to-layer memory coordination
- **NVIDIA Profiling**: Complete performance verification
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and thread safety

## 🔬 How STORM Works

### Forward Pass (Offloading)
1. Layer N computes output and activation on Compute Stream
2. Activation immediately offloaded to CPU RAM using pinned memory
3. Asynchronous D2H transfer on Transfer Stream (non-blocking)

### Backward Pass (Orchestration)
1. Layer N backward starts, immediately triggers fetch for Layer N-1
2. H2D transfer begins on Transfer Stream
3. Layer N gradient computation runs on Compute Stream
4. JIT synchronization ensures data ready before Layer N-1 computation

### Zero-Stall Architecture
- GPU compute and memory transfer run concurrently
- Transfer time hidden behind computation time
- Event-based synchronization ensures proper ordering
